# Budget Tracker

A React Native budget tracker I built for myself in order to track my spendings troughout the month.



## Functionality
- Add new spendings in the **Home Screen**
- See information about spendings for previous months in the **History Screen**
- Assign a category to each spending
- See what percentage of each month's spendings went to what category
## What I learned while creating this project
